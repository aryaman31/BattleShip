# BattleShip
A copy of the board game battleship, but in console.

I made this game as a mini project for school.

When you start, you will be asked to place 4 tanks on a 8 by 8 board. Then based on what you chose at the menu, the game will start. The bombing Co-ordinate has to be entered as row, coloumn and if you hit, the letter "H" will be displayed at that location, if miss then "A" will be displayed (No particular reason why A).
